# Team Rocket Delivery Network Poke Ball Tracer

This project contains a Python program designed to aid in identifying which Team Rocket Delivery Agents possess which Poke Ball packages.
Documentation for its behavior can be found publicly here: http://cpl.mwisely.xyz
To verify that the code works properly, you must complete any partial test functions that are given.

**Note: Follow the design specifications EXACTLY.**
Not doing so will break our existing, complete test suite and hurt your grade.
In addition to running your unit tests, we will be evaluating your program's output for proper results.
Because of this, the format of your output must match the sample output provided on the homework posting.

## Regarding Tests

The unit tests have been partially implemented.
You should consider adding to them to ensure your code works properly.

## Run Your Tests

To run your tests, do the following:

~~~shell
# Assuming that you are at the top directory of your project
./py.test
~~~~

**Note: this will work on campus machines. If you use your own machine, you are on your own.**

## Checking Your Style

To check your style with flake8, do the following:

~~~shell
# Assuming that you are at the top directory of your project
./flake8 *.py
~~~~

## Running the Program

To run the tracker, do the following:

~~~shell
# Assuming that you are at the top directory of your project
# This will print out the usage for your program
python3.4 main.py
~~~
